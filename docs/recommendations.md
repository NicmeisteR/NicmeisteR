## **Recommendations**

### MJ Meyer
*UX Lead/Front-end Developer - Product Team at InfoSlips*  
January 16, 2021, MJ was Nicolaas' mentor
 
I originally know Nico as a passionate gamer. Especially with Halo multiplayer. He was always eager to build and support the local community, organise tournaments, coach and assist amateur players, and study every aspect of the game to become one of the best players.

When Nico started working at the same company at the time as a junior developer, I knew if he could transfer the same passion to his career, he would be a GREAT asset to any team. This is exactly what Nico did. He's always eager to learn something new. He shows initiative by building tools and improving processes on top of all his work load, and he's more than capable to take on a task that's outside of his expertise, adapt, learn and master that area.

I would gladly work with Nico again. 

### Donovan van der Linde
*Software Developer - Template Team at InfoSlips*  
June 13, 2020, Nicolaas worked with Donovan in the same group
 
Nico will go on to do great things. I really do believe this. Capable, dedicated, innovative and willing to do whatever is necessary to get done when you need it done. I will be watching your Github dude! I'm excited to see what else you come up with!
