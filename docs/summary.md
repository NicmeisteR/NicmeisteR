## SUMMARY

I'm a 23 year old Web/Software Engineer from Pretoria (South Africa) currently based in Garstfontein. I love everything that has to do with development & innovation, graphic design, streaming and gaming.

I have a true devotion to automation and creativity.

I have 3+ years of working experience as a developer and working in a close knit team, but I'm ready to visit other countries and find the company that aligns with my passion. I love working with people, especially if they have the same passion for coding as I have.

I'm super passionate about development and increasing/broadening my knowledge and skills.

I believe that working hard and improving myself is the key to success and spend almost all of my free time coding and studying new things, to not only improve as a developer but to improve as a person.

The sky's the limit, so shoot for the stars.

I love code!

Why don't we work together? I can guarantee that I will be an asset to the team.
